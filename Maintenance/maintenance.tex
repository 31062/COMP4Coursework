\chapter{System Maintenance}

\section{Environment}

\subsection{Software}
In creating this system have have lots of different software to preform different tasks: Python 3; is a loosely typed 3rd generation programing language which is easy to learn wither u have programming experience or not. IDLE; is where you physically write your code for python, IDLE is used to write python script as well as run a python script, including displaying errors. SQLite 3; is part of the standard library of python and is used to create and use databases within python.

\subsection{Usage Explanation}
the reasoning behind using the software i used
the main reason for this is that is the language that i am most familiar. python is also easy to installed on any machine making it a good choice when I have write parts of this system from three different machines all with different hardware and software installed on them.
