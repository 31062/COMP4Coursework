        1.1 & to test the main menu functions proberly  & black bock testing & the use will only enter one valur into this menu and this part of the system only directs the user to a sub menu there is no real precessing thus it is best to test with what output the system gives \\ \hline
1.2 &to test the "insert new line into database" menu & white box testing & i will use white box testing as there are multiple ways the user can get to the end of this sub menu via any of the 12 options.\\ \hline
1.3 & to test the "edit currenlty exsisting line in database" menu & white box testing & i will use white box testing 12 differnt initial options which then can have a munber of secondery options. this plart of the program also gives no prompt that the database has been changed so black box testing it not an option. \\ \hline
1.4 & to test "make transation" menu & black box testing & this part of the system can have many differnt roots to get through it but these option are only minor such as a differnt user or stock item. \\ \hline
1.5 & to test "delete line from database" menu & black box testing & this part of the system is very easy to tell if it is working properly because it has a lot of output steaments therefore black box testing is ok to use \\ \hline

1.2 &to test the "insert new line into database" menu & black box & i am only testing is the system starts a process rather than testing a complex algorithm\\ \hline
1.3 & to test the "edit currently existing line in database" menu & black box &  i am only testing is the system starts a process rather than testing a complex algorithm. \\ \hline
