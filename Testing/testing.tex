\subsection{Outline Plan}

I do not have an original outline from the design section as i ran out of time.

        \textbf{Test Series} & \textbf{Purpose of Test Series} & \textbf{Testing Strategy} & \textbf{Strategy Rationale}\\  \hline

        1.1 & to test the main menu functions properly  & black bock testing & the use will only enter one value into this menu and this part of the system only directs the user to a sub menu there is no real precessing thus it is best to test with what output the system gives \\ \hline
1.2 &to test the "insert new line into database" menu & white box testing & i will use white box testing as there are multiple ways the user can get to the end of this sub menu via any of the 12 options.\\ \hline
1.3 & to test the "edit currently existing line in database" menu & white box testing & i will use white box testing 12 different initial options which then can have a number of secondary options. this part of the program also gives no prompt that the database has been changed so black box testing it not an option. \\ \hline
1.4 & to test "make transaction" menu & black box testing & this part of the system can have many different roots to get through it but these option are only minor such as a different user or stock item. \\ \hline
1.5 & to test "delete line from database" menu & modular / black box & this part of the system is all in on modal so i will test the whole modal by its self however i will not be looking at the code its self only the outputs the system gives hence i will be black box testing \\ \hline

1.1 & to test the main menu functions properly  & black bock testing & the use will only enter one value into this menu and this part of the system only directs the user to a sub menu there is no real precessing thus it is best to test with what output the system gives \\ \hline
1.2 &to test the "insert new line into database" menu & black box & i am currently testing if the system starts a process rather than testing the algorithm at this time\\ \hline
1.3 & to test the "edit currently existing line in database" menu & black box &  i am currently only testing is the system starts a process rather than testing a complex algorithm. \\ \hline
1.4 & to test "make transaction" process & black box testing & this part of the system can have many different roots to get through it but these option are only minor such as a different user or stock item. \\ \hline
1.5 & to test "delete line from database" menu & black box testing & this part of the system is very easy to tell if it is working properly because it has a lot of output statements therefore black box testing is okay to use \\ \hline
